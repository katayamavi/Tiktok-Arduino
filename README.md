TiktokxArduino follower counter. 

I did this for my YT and Tiktok Channels:

Basic notes: 
Components: Arduino Nano, Aliex-Adafruit 0.96" LCD clone. 
Python gets the data from your followers count and sends it to arduino. 
In order to find each other (arduino and python) instead of selecting a port I use a dumb autodiscovery method.

If you have any questions let me know.
